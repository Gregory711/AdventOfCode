'''
Start with platform like below:
O....#....
O.OO#....#
.....##...
OO.#O....O
.O.....O#.
O.#..O.#.#
..O..#O..O
.......O..
#....###..
#OO..#....
The 0s are rocks that can roll, the # are rocks that stay in place, and .s are empty.
If you tilt the platform so all the 0s roll as far north as they can you end you end up with:
OOOO.#.O.. 10
OO..#....#  9
OO..O##..O  8
O..#.OO...  7
........#.  6
..#....#.#  5
..O..#.O.O  4
..O.......  3
#....###..  2
#....#....  1
The numbers on right are their distance to south support beams, multiply it by them and you get 136 the total load and answer!
