536753 is too high.
Maybe - followed by a number counts as a negative number?
If so subtract 3154 (well maybe less cause if - not a symbol then not all of those negative numbers included)
536753-3154=533599 is too low so maybe that was it will find just the negative numbers connected to symbol
not sure if the negative can count if its connected to a symbol?
that was counted as too low (533599)
644
so 536753-644=536109
too high
went to r/adventofcode and looked at posts w/o spoilers of people who do good on test cases but not on actual input
Turns out that no minus not = negative numbers BUT newline character at end could be wrongly detected as symbol
yep, using str.rstrip() for now on to remove all kinds of trailing whitespace
