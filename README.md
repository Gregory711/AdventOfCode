# 2023

First time participating, using it as a way to improve my Python skills.

Problems are in folders named by the day e.g. 1 is December 1st.
Part one has a topical label based on the story e.g. oasis.py and part two is oasis2.py
Provided test data in test.txt and actual data in input.txt
Can run problems like following: python oasis.py input.txt
Currently 1-9 inclusive are finished with exception of part two for days 5 and 8.

Environment Setup Instructions (note: python is an alias for python3):
cd 2023
python -m venv advent
source advent/bin/activate
pip install pydantic
